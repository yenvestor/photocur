## LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

### ✅ SAFE TO IMPLEMENT:
- All basic image editing algorithms (blending, transformations, filters)
- Standard UI patterns used across image editors
- Common tool behaviors and workflows
- Open-source image processing techniques
- Standard file format support
- Mathematical operations on pixels

### ⚠️ AVOID IMPLEMENTING:
- Adobe's specific proprietary AI models (we can use open alternatives)
- Exact Photoshop menu layouts (we can create similar but distinct)
- Adobe's specific filter algorithms (we can create equivalent effects)
- Trademarked terms like "Photoshop" (we use generic terms)

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: Core Tools (COMPLETED)
✓ Basic selection tools
✓ Painting tools (brush, pencil, eraser)
✓ Layer management
✓ Canvas and zoom controls
✓ File operations

### Phase 2: Advanced Tools (IN PROGRESS)
- Retouching tools (clone, healing)
- Vector tools (pen, shapes)
- Text tools
- Transform tools
- More selection tools

### Phase 3: Professional Features
- Advanced layer features
- Filters and effects
- Color management
- Actions/macros
- Batch processing

### Phase 4: AI Features
- Background removal
- Content-aware tools
- Smart selection
- Auto-corrections

This research confirms we can legally build a comprehensive image editor with professional-grade features comparable to Photoshop/Photopea while avoiding any copyright or patent issues.
